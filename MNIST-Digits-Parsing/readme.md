# MNIST Digits Parsing

This is a side project meant to help with my current main project, [MNIST-Digits-Recognition-Neural-Network](https://github.com/isaacault/MNIST-Digits-Recognition-Neural-Network). The purpose of this project is to swap endianness of the MNIST data and parse it for the main project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

A C Compiler such as GCC's gcc


### Compiling

Open the project folder in terminal and execute "make".


### Executing

The binary will be called "mnist_parse". To execute, run "./mnist_parse".




## Built With
